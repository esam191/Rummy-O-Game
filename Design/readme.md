This folder contains all our design artifacts for our RummyO game. 
It includes the design and its association among our components.
All behavioral models such as sequence and state diagrams are included.

##### Class Diagram.pdf
Our class diagram describes the structure of our game by presenting the attributes, operation and relationship among objects. It's included in the Class Diagram.pdf file.
There are seven classes: 
1. System (parent class)
2. User 
3. Tiles
4. Room
5. Player
6. Hand
7. Tile Set

##### Sequence Diagram.pdf
Our sequence diagram shows how messages between objects are exchanged in order to carry out the functionality of the game.

##### State Diagram.pdf
Our state diagram models the behaviour of a class in response to time and changing external stimuli.

##### Detailed State Diagram.pdf
We also included a detailed state diagram that describes each state in detail as the game is played.

##### Design Review Checklist.pdf
We have also included the design review checklist which inspects on the completeness and correctness, consistency and traceability of our design. It checks if the relationship between the components are explicitly documented including if the designs were described clear and traceable to the requirements.
