This folder contains all our design artifacts for our RummyO game. 
It includes the design and its association among our components.
All behavioral models such as sequence and state diagrams are included.

Our class diagram describes the structure of our game by presenting the attributes, operation and relationship among objects.
There are seven classes: 
1. System (parent class)
2. User 
3. Tiles
4. Room
5. Player
6. Hand
7. Tile Set

Our sequence diagram shows how messages between objects are exchanged in order to carry out the functionality of the game.

We have also included the design review checklist which inspects on the completeness and correctness, consistency and traceability of our design. It checks if the relationship between the components are explicitly documented including if the designs were described clear and traceable to the requirements.
