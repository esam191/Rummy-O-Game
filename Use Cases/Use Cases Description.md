# Following are the descriptions for each use case
## Login/Signup
As a user, I want to be able to use this platform. I provide my details and the system registers my information. If I entered the wrong information, I should get prompted with an error message.

## Creating a Game Room
As a player, I want to invite my friends and create a game room where we can play. I want to start a game and create a room and give the invite link to my friends so they can join.

## Joining a Game Room
As a secondary player, I will be able to join an existing room created by the primary player. This will allow me to edit the room and have a platform to play the game with other players.

## Starting the Game
As a user, I want to to be able to start the game once I have logged in. I should be able to choose starting player then the rest of the players can start playing the game. The server distributes and shuffles the tiles prior to playing the game.

## Make Initial Meld
When the game starts, each player has to be able to make an initial meld of 25 points. If the player does not have enough tiles to make an initial meld, he or she then takes one tile from the remaining and adds it to his or her collection. 

## Play Turn
Note that the objective of the game is to eliminate all the tiles in a player's hand first. This is achieved by making either runs and sets or by adding to other runs and sets on the table. If no play can be made during a turn, the
player has to pick a tile.

## Ending the Game
The room server is responsible to end the game. The server ends the round when a player has no tile left in their hand.
