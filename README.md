In this file you should give an overview of the software product and links to the different artifacts in your repository.
It is somewhat like a table of contents with the addition of a product overview.
This is the entry point for the grading of the project. 
If you can also have a link to the execution of the code that would be great but not a requirement.
This is possible by leveraging the GitHub Actions Node.js functionality (I am assuming that your project is leveraging Node.js)
