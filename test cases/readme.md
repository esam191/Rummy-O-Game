This folder contains all the test cases that we performed in our code including unit test, continous integration test and acceptance test.
Acceptance test demonstrates that the rummyO game has achieved its business requirements.
In the tabular list of unit and integration test cases each test case has a unique ID(TC-001 - TC-020), test case description and the expected result.
