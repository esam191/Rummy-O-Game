### Introduction (Requiremenst:READ-ME )
This folder contains the stakeholders requirements which was initially captured as user stories which is then interpreted into a set of formal requirements in accordance with the Unified process design approach.

In the tabular list of requirements each requirement has a unique requirement ID( REQ-001 - REQ-015), priority level and its description.
Higher number in the priority level implies that the the requirement is highly prioritized and vice versa, having said that our product being a web based multiplayer game is our highest priority and our system retreiving points of players after the connection is lost is the least.
Our requirement review checklist examines for the following things: 
* Organization and structure of the documentation
* Completeness and correctness
* consistency and clarity
* Traceability
